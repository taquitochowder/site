Hi, I'm Thakee Chowdhury,
currently a senior Computer Science student
at Rutgers University.

The main goal of this site is to
establish my place on the internet and
allow myself to braindump stuff on my mind
that I wouldn't mind other people seeing.
Opinions are expected,
but critiques are appreciated.

You can check out some stuff I've coded,
including this very website,
at my [Github](https://github.com/taquitochowder).

All images you'll see,
unless otherwise specified,
were found on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
The images are embedded with [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/).
I highly recommend Unsplash if you need
freely usable photos for whatever reason.
