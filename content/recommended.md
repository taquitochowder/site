Here you'll find stuff I recommend.
What constitutes stuff?
Literally anything.
There's no rhyme or reason to anything here.
I will only recommend stuff
that I can confidently say
is somewhat useful or
was a net benefit to my life.

- [Web Browser](#web-browser)
  - [Extensions](#extensions)
- [Pencils](#pencils)

## Web Browser

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Out of all of the major web browsers,
Firefox is the only one I can really trust
for privacy and security.

### Extensions

*Note: all of these extensions are available for Firefox,*
*but may not be available for other browsers.*

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin)

The only adblocker you should use.

- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)

Always make sure you're using HTTPS.
If a website doesn't support it,
you probably shouldn't visit it.

- [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)

A nice extension to combo with uBlock Origin for extra privacy.
It blocks requests from loading resources from big CDNS
like Google and Cloudflare,
and instead serve those resources locally
if the extensions has them.
That's a simple description,
so I recommend reading up on the [wiki](https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes/-/wikis/home)
if you want more details.

- [ClearURLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)

Cleans URLs of tracking elements.
No more crazy long Amazon URLs like this:

> `https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011`

- [CanvasBlocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/)

Prevents some Javascript APIs from being used for fingerprinting.

## Pencils

- [rOtring 600](https://www.rotring.com/us/mechanical-pencils/290-rotring-600-mechanical-pencil-3501178523096.html#)

If you're used to buying packs of mechanical pencils for a few dollars,
than the price of this thing is gonna be a shocker (I bought it for $19).
But, I would say it's well worth the cost.
I've used it for my entire college career and
without fail it's been the most pleasant writing tool I have ever used.
The full metal body is super nice to use,
but a bit hefty.
I almost certain my finger muscles have gotten stronger
because of this thing.

- [uni-ball KURU TOGA](https://uniballco.com/kuru-toga-1/)

While not my main pencil,
this one is actually quite nice to write with
because of its main feature: rotation.
The lead rotates while you write to
make sure it's always sharp.
